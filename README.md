# Parkinson's Disease Prediction System

Welcome to the **Parkinson's Disease Prediction System** — a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of Parkinson’s Disease based on biomedical voice measurements. This project was developed as part of an **academic Machine Learning project** during the **third year (5th semester)** of the undergraduate program.

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning to assist in early detection of Parkinson’s Disease, providing valuable insights for medical research and potential clinical applications.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predicts **Parkinson's Disease** status (**Positive** or **Negative**) from input biomedical voice features.
- ✅ Displays **UPDRS (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale)** scores to offer additional context on the patient’s motor function.
- ✅ Classifies severity levels into **Mild**, **Moderate**, and **Severe** for better interpretability.
- ✅ Clean and intuitive **user interface** designed with **Bootstrap 5**.
- ✅ Smooth **loading animation** (spinner) during prediction for improved experience.
